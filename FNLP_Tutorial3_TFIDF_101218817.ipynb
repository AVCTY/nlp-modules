Take these first few paragraphs\n","from the Wikipedia article on kites:\n","\n","A kite is traditionally a tethered heavier-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react Against the air to create lift and drag. A kite consists of wings, tethers, and anchors. Kites often have a bridle to guide the face of the kite at the correct angle so the wind can lift it. A kite’s wing also may be so designed so a bridle is not needed; when kiting a sailplane for launch, the tether meets the wing at a single point. A kite may\n","have fixed or moving anchors. Untraditionally in technical kiting, a kite consists of tether-set-coupled wing sets; even in technical kiting, though, a wing in the system is still often called the kite. The lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air flows around the kite’s surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed\n","by the tension of one or more of the lines or tethers to which the kite is attached. The anchor point of the kite line may be static or moving (such as the towing of a kite by a running person, boat, free-falling anchors as in paragliders and fugitive parakites or vehicle). The same principles of fluid flow apply in liquids and kites are also used under water. A hybrid tethered craft comprising both a lighter-than-air balloon as well as a kite lifting surface is called a kytoon."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"moLXVKj1JEND"},"source":["Assign

It will be obvious that any details\\nwhich would help the reader exactly to identify the college or the\\ncriminal would be injudicious and offensive. So painful a scan-\\ndal may well be allowed to die out. With due discretion the\\nincident itself may, however, be described, since it serves to\\nillustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was re-\\nmarkable. I will endeavour, in my statement, to avoid such terms\\nas would serve to limit the events to any particular place, or give\\na clue as to the people concerned.\\n  We were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a\\nlibrary where Sherlock Holmes was pursuing some laborious\\nresearches in early English charters -- researches which led to\\nresults so striking that they may be the subject of one of my\\nfuture narratives. Here it was that one evening we received a\\nvisit from an acquaintance, Mr. Hilton Soames, tutor and lec-\\nturer at the College of St. Luke\\'s. Mr. Soames was a tall, spare\\nman, of a nervous and excitable temperament. I had always\\nknown him to be restless in his manner, but on this particular\\noccasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it\\nwas clear something very unusual had occurred.\\n  \"I trust, Mr. Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of\\nyour valuable time. We have had a very painful incident at St.\\nLuke\\'s, and really, but for the happy chance of your being in\\ntown, I should have been at a loss what to do.\"\\n  \"I am very busy just now, and I desire no distractions,\" my\\nfriend answered. \"I should much prefer that you called in the aid\\nof the police.\"\\n  \"No, no, my dear sir; such a course is utterly impossible.\\nWhen once the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again, and this\\nis just one of those cases where, for the credit of the college, it is\\nmost essential to avoid scandal. Your discretion is as well known\\nas your powers, and you are the one man in the world who can\\nhelp me. I beg you, Mr. Holmes, to do what you can.\"\\n  My friend\\'s temper had not improved since he had been\\ndeprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street. Without\\nhis scrapbooks, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was\\nan uncomfortable man. He shrugged his shoulders in ungracious\\nacquiescence, while our visitor in hurried words and with much\\nexcitable gesticulation poured forth his story.\\n  \"I must explain to you, Mr. Holmes, that to-morrow is the\\nfirst day of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship. I am\\none of the examiners. My subject is Greek, and the first of the\\npapers consists of a large passage of Greek translation which the\\ncandidate has not seen. This passage is printed on the examina-\\ntion paper, and it would naturally be an immense advantage if\\nthe candidate could prepare it in advance. For this reason, great\\ncare is taken to keep the paper secret.\\n  \"To-day, about three o\\'clock, the proofs of this paper arrived\\nfrom the printers. The exercise consists of half a chapter of\\nThucydides. I had to read it over carefully, as the text must be\\nabsolutely correct. At four-thirty my task was not yet completed.\\nI had, however, promised to take tea in a friend\\'s rooms, so I\\nleft the proof upon my desk. I was absent rather more than an\\nhour.\\n  \"You are aware, Mr. Holmes, that our college doors are\\ndouble -- a green baize one within and a heavy oak one without.\\nAs I approached my outer door, I was amazed to see a key in it.\\nFor an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on\\nfeeling in my pocket I found that it was all right. The only\\nduplicate which existed, so far as I knew, was that which\\nbelonged to my servant, Bannister -- a man who has looked after\\nmy room for ten years, and whose honesty is absolutely above\\nsuspicion. I found that the key was indeed his, that he had\\nentered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very\\ncarelessly left the key in the door when he came out. His visit to\\nmy room must have been within a very few minutes of my\\nleaving it. His forgetfulness about the key would have mattered\\nlittle upon any other occasion, but on this one day it has pro-\\nduced the most deplorable consequences.\\n  \"The moment I looked at my table, I was aware that someone\\nhad rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long\\nslips. I had left them all together. Now, I found that one of them\\nwas lying on the floor, one was on the side table near the\\nwindow, and the third was where I had left it.\"\\n  Holmes stirred for the first time.\\n  \"The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the\\nthird where you left it,\" said he.\\n  \"Exactly, Mr. Holmes. You amaze me. How could you possi-\\nbly know that?\"\\n  \"Pray continue your very interesting statement.\"\\n  \"For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpar-\\ndonable liberty of examining my papers. He denied it, however,\\nwith the utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was\\nspeaking the truth. The alternative was that someone passing had\\nobserved the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had\\nentered to look at the papers. A large sum of money is at stake,\\nfor the scholarship is a very valuable one, and an unscrupulous\\nman might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage\\nover his fellows.\\n  \"Bannister was very much upset by the incident. He had\\nnearly fainted when we found that the papers had undoubtedly\\nbeen tampered with. I gave him a little brandy and left him\\ncollapsed in a chair, while I made a most careful examination of\\nthe room. I soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his\\npresence besides the rumpled papers. On the table in the window\\nwere several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened. A\\nbroken tip of lead was lying there also. Evidently the rascal had\\ncopied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and had\\nbeen compelled to put a fresh point to it.\"\\n  \"Excellent!\" said Holmes, who was recovering his good-\\nhumour as his attention became more engrossed by the case.\\n\"Fortune has been your friend.\"\\n  \"This was not all. I have a new writing-table with a fine\\nsurface of red leather. I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannis-\\nter, that it was smooth and unstained. Now I found a clean cut in\\nit about three inches long -- not a mere scratch, but a positive cut.\\nNot only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black\\ndough or clay, with specks of something which looks like saw-\\ndust in it. I am convinced that these marks were left by the man\\nwho rifled the papers. There were no footmarks and no other\\nevidence as to his identity. I was at my wit\\'s end, when suddenly\\nthe happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town, and\\nI came straight round to put the matter into your hands. Do help\\nme, Mr. Holmes. You see my dilemma. Either I must find the\\nman or else the examination must be postponed until fresh papers\\nare prepared, and since this cannot be done without explanation,\\nthere will ensue a hideous scandal, which will throw a cloud not\\nonly on the college, but on the university. Above all things, I\\ndesire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly.\"\\n  \"I shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice\\nas I can,\" said Holmes, rising and putting on his overcoat.\\n\"The case is not entirely devoid of interest. Had anyone visited\\nyou in your room after the papers came to you?\"\\n  \"Yes, young Daulat Ras, an Indian student, who lives on the\\nsame stair, came in to ask me some particulars about the exami-\\nnation.\"\\n  \"For which he was entered?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  \"And the papers were on your table?\"\\n  \"To the best of my belief, they were rolled up.\"\\n  \"But might be recognized as proofs?\"\\n  \"Possibly.\"\\n  \"No one else in your room?\"\\n  \"No.\"\\n  \"Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?\"\\n  \"No one save the printer.\"\\n  \"Did this man Bannister know?\"\\n  \"No, certainly not. No one knew.\"\\n  \"Where is Bannister now?\"\\n  \"He was very ill, poor fellow. I left him collapsed in the\\nchair. I was in such a hurry to come to you.\"\\n  \"You left your door open?\"\\n  \"I locked up the papers first.\"\\n  \"Then it amounts to this, Mr. Soames: that, unless the Indian\\nstudent recognized the roll as being proofs, the man who tam-\\npered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing\\nthat they were there.\"\\n  \"So it seems to me.\"\\n  Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.\\n  \"Well,\" said he. \"let us go round. Not one of your cases.\\nWatson -- mental, not physical. All right; come if you want to.\\nNow, Mr. Soames -- at your disposal!\"\\n  The sitting-room of our client opened by a long, low, latticed\\nwindow on to the ancient lichen-tinted court of the old college.\\nA Gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase. On the\\nground floor was the tutor\\'s room. Above were three students,\\none on each story. It was already twilight when we reached the\\nscene of our problem. Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the\\nwindow. Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his\\nneck craned, he looked into the room.\\n  \"He must have entered through the door. There is no opening\\nexcept the one pane,\" said our learned guide.\\n  \"Dear me!\" said Holmes, and he smiled in a singular way as\\nhe glanced at our companion. \"Well, if there is nothing to be\\nlearned here, we had best go inside.\"\\n  The lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his\\nroom. We stood at the entrance while Holmes made an examina-\\ntion of the carpet.\\n  \"I am afraid there are no signs here,\" said he. \"One could\\nhardly hope for any upon so dry a day. Your servant seems to\\nhave quite recovered. You left him in a chair, you say. Which\\nchair?\"\\n  \"By the window there.\"\\n  \"I see. Near this little table. You can come in now. I have\\nfinished with the carpet. Let us take the little table first. Of\\ncourse, what has happened is very clear. The man entered and\\ntook the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table. He\\ncarried them over to the window table, because from there he\\ncould see if you came across the courtyard, and so could effect\\nan escape.\"\\n  \"As a matter of fact, he could not,\" said Soames, \"for I\\nentered by the side door.\"\\n  \"Ah, that\\'s good! Well, anyhow, that was in his mind. Let\\nme see the three strips. No finger impressions -- no! Well he\\ncarried over this one first, and he copied it. How long wouid it\\ntake him to do that, using every possible contraction? A quarter\\nof an hour, not less. Then he tossed it down and seized the next.\\nHe was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make\\na very hurried retreat -- very hurried, since he had not time to\\nreplace the papers which would tell you that he had been there.\\nYou were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you\\nentered the outer door?\"\\n  \"No, I can\\'t say I was.\"\\n  \"Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and\\nhad, as you observe, to sharpen it again. This is of interest,\\nWatson. The pencil was not an ordinary one. It was above the\\nusual size, with a soft lead, the outer colour was dark blue, the\\nmaker\\'s name was printed in silver lettering, and the piece\\nremaining is only about an inch and a half long. Look for such a\\npencil, Mr. Soames, and you have got your man. When I add\\nthat he possesses a large and very blunt knife, you have an\\nadditional aid.\"\\n  Mr. Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of\\ninformation. \"I can follow the other points,\" said he, \"but\\nreally, in this matter of the length --\"\\n  Holmes held out a small chip with the letters NN and a space\\nof clear wood after them.\\n  \"You see?\"\\n  \"No, I fear that even now --\"\\n  \"Watson, I have always done you an injustice. There are\\nothers. What could this NN be? It is at the end of a word. You\\nare aware that Johann Faber is the most common maker\\'s name.\\nIs it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as\\nusually follows the Johann?\" He held the small table sideways to\\nthe electric light. \"I was hoping that if the paper on which he\\nwrote was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this\\npolished surface. No, I see nothing. I don\\'t think there is any-\\nthing more to be learned here. Now for the central table. This\\nsmall pellet is, I presume, the black, doughy mass you spoke of.\\nRoughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out, I perceive. As\\nyou say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it. Dear me, this\\nis very interesting. And the cut -- a positive tear, I see. It began\\nwith a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole. I am much\\nindebted to you for directing my attention to this case, Mr.\\nSoames. Where does that door lead to?\"\\n  \"To my bedroom.\"\\n  \"Have you been in it since your adventure?\"\\n  \"No, I came straight away for you.\"\\n  \"I should like to have a glance round. What a charming,\\nold-fashioned room! Perhaps you will kindly wait a minute, until\\nI have examined the floor. No, I see nothing. What about this\\ncurtain? You hang your clothes behind it. If anyone were forced\\nto conceal himself in this room he must do it there, since the bed\\nis too low and the wardrobe too shallow. No one there, I\\nsuppose?\"\\n  As Holmes drew the curtain I was aware, from some little\\nrigidity and alertness of his attitude, that he was prepared for an\\nemergency. As a matter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed\\nnothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of\\npegs. Holmes turned away, and stooped suddenly to the floor.\\n  \"Halloa! What\\'s this?\" said he.\\n  It was a small pyramid of black, putty-like stuff, exactly like\\nthe one upon the table of the study. Holmes held it out on his\\nopen palm in the glare of the electric light.\\n  \"Your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as\\nwell as in your sitting-room, Mr. Soames.\"\\n  \"What could he have wanted there?\"\\n  \"I think it is clear enough. You came back by an unexpected\\nway, and so he had no warning until you were at the very door.\\nWhat could he do? He caught up everything which would betray\\nhim, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.\"\\n  \"Good gracious, Mr. Holmes, do you mean to tell me that, all\\nthe time I was talking to Bannister in this room, we had the man\\nprisoner if we had only known it?\"\\n  \"So I read it.\"\\n  \"Surely there is another alternative, Mr. Holmes. I don\\'t\\nknow whether you observed my bedroom window?\"\\n  \"Lattice-paned, lead framework, three separate windows, one\\nswinging on hinge, and large enough to admit a man.\"\\n  \"Exactly. And it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as\\nto be partly invisible. The man might have effected his entrance\\nthere, left traces as he passed through the bedroom, and finally,\\nfinding the door open, have escaped that way.\"\\n  Holmes shook his head impatiently.\\n  \"Let us be practical,\" said he. \"I understand you to say that\\nthere are three students who use this stair, and are in the habit of\\npassing your door?\"\\n  \"Yes, there are.\"\\n  \"And they are all in for this examination?\"\\n  \"Yes.\"\\n  \"Have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than\\nthe others?\"\\n  Soames hesitated.\\n  \"It is a very delicate question.\" said he. \"One hardly likes to\\nthrow suspicion where there are no proofs.\"\\n  \"Let us hear the suspicions. I will look after the proofs.\"\\n  \"I will tell you, then, in a few words the character of the three\\nmcn who inhabit these rooms. The lower of the three is Gilchrist,\\na fine scholar and athletc, plays in the Rugby team and the\\ncricket team for the college, and got his Blue for the hurdles and\\nthe long jump. He is a fine, manly fellow. His father was the\\nnotorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist, who ruined himself on the turf. My\\nscholar has been left very poor, but he is hard-working and\\nindustrious. He will do well.\\n  \"The second floor is inhabited by Daulat Ras, the Indian. He\\nis a quiet, inscrutable fellow; as most of those Indians are. He is\\nwell up in his work, though his Greek is his weak subject. He is\\nsteady and methodical.\\n  \"The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren. He is a brilliant\\nfellow when he chooses to work -- one of the brightest intellects\\nof the university; but he is wayward, dissipated, and unprinci-\\npled. He was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first\\nyear. He has been idling all this term, and he must look forward\\nwith dread to the examination.\"\\n  \"Then it is he whom you suspect?\"\\n  \"I dare not go so far as that. But, of the three, he is perhaps the\\nleast unlikely.\"\\n  \"Exactly. Now, Mr. Soames, let us have a look at your\\nservant, Bannister.\"\\n  He was a little, white-faced, clean-shaven, grizzly-haired fel-\\nlow of fifty. He was still suffering from this sudden disturbance\\nof the quiet routine of his life. His plump face was twitching\\nwith his nervousness, and his fingers could not keep still.\\n  \"We are investigating this unhappy business, Bannister,\" said\\nhis master.\\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\\n  \"I understand,\" said Holmes, \"that you left your key in the\\ndoor?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\\n  \"Was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the\\nvery day when there were these papers inside?\"\\n  \"It was most unfortunate. sir. But I have occasionally done\\nthe same thing at other times.\"\\n  \"When did you enter the room?\"\\n  It was about half-past four. That is Mr. Soames\\'s tea time.\"\\n  \"How long did you stay?\"\\n  \"When I saw that he was absent. I withdrew at once.\"\\n  \"Did you look at these papers on the table?\"\\n  \"No, sir certainly not.\"\\n  \"How came you to leave the key in the door?\"\\n  \"I had the tea-tray in my hand. I thought I would come back\\nfor the key. Then I forgot.\"\\n  \"Has the outer door a spring lock?\"\\n  \"No, sir.\"\\n  \"Then it was open all the time?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\\n  \"Anyone in the room could get out?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir.\"\\n  \"When Mr. Soames returned and called for you, you were\\nvery much disturbed?\"\\n  \"Yes, sir. Such a thing has never happened during the many\\nyears that I have been here. I nearly fainted, sir.\"\\n  \"So I understand. Where were you when you began to feel\\nbad?\"\\n  \"Where was I, sir? Why, here, near the door.\"\\n  \"That is singular, because you sat down in that chair over\\nyonder near the corner. Why did you pass these other chairs?\"\\n  \"I don\\'t know, sir, it didn\\'t matter to me where I sat.\"\\n  \"I really don\\'t think he knew much about it, Mr. Holmes. He\\nwas looking very bad -- quite ghastly.\"\\n  \"You stayed here when your master left?\"\\n  \"Only for a minute or so. Then I locked the door and went to\\nmy room.\"\\n  \"Whom do you suspect?\"\\n  \"Oh, I would not venture to say, sir. I don\\'t believe there is\\nany gentleman in this university who is capable of profiting by\\nsuch an action. No, sir, I\\'ll not believe it.\"\\n  \"Thank you, that will do,\" said Holmes. \"Oh, one more\\nword. You have not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen\\nwhom you attend that anything is amiss?\"\\n  \"No, sir -- not a word.\"\\n  \"You haven\\'t seen any of them?\"\\n  \"No, sir.\"\\n  \"Very good. Now, Mr. Soames, we will take a walk in the\\nquadrangle, if you please.\"\\n  Three yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering\\ngloom.\\n  \"Your three birds are all in their nests,\" said Holmes, looking\\nup. \"Halloa! What\\'s that? One of them seems restless enough.\"\\n  It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly\\nupon his blind. He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.\\n  \"I should like to have a peep at each of them,\" said Holmes.\\n\"Is it possible?\"\\n  \"No difficulty in the world,\" Soames answered. \"This set of\\nrooms is quite the oldest in the college, and it is not unusual for\\nvisitors to go over them. Come along, and I will personally\\nconduct you.\"\\n  \"No names, please!\" said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist\\'s\\ndoor. A tall, flaxen-haired, slim young fellow opened it, and\\nmade us welcome when he understood our errand. There were\\nsome really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture\\nwithin. Holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted\\non drawing it in his notebook, broke his pencil, had to borrow\\none from our host, and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his\\nown. The same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of\\nthe Indian -- a silent, little, hook-nosed fellow, who eyed us\\naskance, and was obviously glad when Holmes\\'s architectural\\nstudies had come to an end. I could not see that in either case\\nHolmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching.\\nOnly at the third did our visit prove abortive. The outer door\\nwould not open to our knock, and-nothing more substantial than\\na torrent of bad language came from behind it. \"I don\\'t care who\\nyou are. You can go to blazes!\" roared the angry voice. \"To-\\nmorrow\\'s the exam, and I won\\'t be drawn by anyone.\"\\n  \"A rude fellow,\" said our guide, flushing with anger as we\\nwithdrew down the stair. \"Of course, he did not realize that it\\nwas I who was knocking, but none the less his conduct was very\\nuncourteous, and, indeed, under the circumstances rather\\nsuspicious.\"\\n  Holmes\\'s response was a curious one.\\n  \"Can you tell me his exact height?\" he asked.\\n  \"Really, Mr. Holmes, I cannot undertake to say. He is taller\\nthan the Indian, not so tall as Gilchrist. I suppose five foot six\\nwould be about it.\"\\n  \"That is very important,\" said Holmes. \"And now, Mr.\\nSoames, I wish you good-night.\"\\n  Our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay. \"Good\\ngracious, Mr. Holmes, you are surely not going to leave me in\\nthis abrupt fashion! You don\\'t seem to realize the position.\\nTo-morrow is the examination. I must take some definite action\\nto-night. I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the\\npapers has been tampered with. The situation must be faced.\"\\n  \"You must leave it as it is. I shall drop round early to-morrow\\nmorning and chat the matter over. It is possible that I may be in\\na position then to indicate some course of action. Meanwhile,\\nyou change nothing -- nothing at all.\"\\n  \"Very good, Mr. Holmes.\"\\n  \"You can be perfectly easy in your mind. We shall certainly\\nfind some way out of your difficulties. I will take the black clay\\nwith me, also the pencil cuttings. Good-bye.\"\\n  When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle, we again\\nlooked up at the windows. The Indian still paced his room. The\\nothers were invisible.\\n  \"Well, Watson, what do you think of it?\" Holmes asked, as\\nwe came out into the main street. \"Quite a little parlour game -- \\nsort of three-card trick, is it not? There are your three men. It\\nmust be one of them. You take your choice. Which is yours?\"\\n  \"The foul-mouthed fellow at the top. He is the one with the\\nworst record. And yet that Indian was a sly fellow also. Why\\nshould he be pacing his room all the time?\"\\n  \"There is nothing in that. Many men do it when they are\\ntrying to learn anything by heart.\"\\n  \"He looked at us in a queer way.\"\\n  \"So would you, if a flock of strangers came in on you when\\nyou were preparing for an examination next day, and every\\nmoment was of value. No, I see nothing in that. Pencils, too,\\nand knives -- all was satisfactory. But that fellow does puzzle\\nme.\"\\n  \"Who?\"\\n  \"Why, Bannister, the servant. What\\'s his game in the matter?\"\\n  \"He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man.\"\\n  \"So he did me. That\\'s the puzzling part. Why should a\\nperfectly honest man -- Well, well, here\\'s a large stationer\\'s. We\\nshall begin our researches here.\"\\n  There were only four stationers of any consequences in the\\ntown, and at each Holmes produced his pencil chips, and bid\\nhigh for a duplicate. All were agreed that one could be ordered,\\nbut that it was not a usual size of pencil, and that it was seldom\\nkept in stock. My friend did not appear to be depressed by his\\nfailure, but shrugged his shoulders in half-humorous resignation.\\n  \"No good, my dear Watson. This, the best and only final\\nclue, has run to nothing. But, indeed, I have little doubt that we\\ncan build up a sufficient case without it. By Jove! my dear\\nfellow, it is nearly nine, and the landlady babbled of green peas\\nat seven-thirty. What with your eternal tobacco, Watson, and\\nyour irregularity at meals, I expect that you will get notice to\\nquit, and that I shall share your downfall -- not, however, before\\nwe have solved the problem of the nervous tutor, the careless\\nservant, and the three enterprising students.\"\\n  Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though\\nhe sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner. At\\neight in the morning, he came into my room just as I finished my\\ntoilet.\\n  \"Well, Watson,\" said he, \"it is time we went down to St.\\nLuke\\'s. Can you do without breakfast?\"\\n  \"Certainly.\"\\n  \"Soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we are able to tell\\nhim something positive.\"\\n  \"Have you anything positive to tell him?\"\\n  \"I think so.\"\\n  \"You have formed a conclusion?\"\\n  \"Yes, my dear Watson, I have solved the mystery.\"\\n  \"But what fresh evidence could you have got?\"\\n  \"Aha! It is not for nothing that I have turned myself out of\\nbed at the untimely hour of six. I have put in two hours\\' hard\\nwork and covered at least five miles, with something to show for\\nit. Look at that!\"\\n  He held out his hand. On the palm were three little pyramids\\nof black, doughy clay.\\n  \"Why, Holmes, you had only two yesterday.\"\\n  \"And one more this morning. It is a fair argument that\\nwherever No. 3 came from is also the source of Nos. 1 and 2.\\nEh, Watson? Well, come along and put friend Soames out of his\\npain.\"\\n  The unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agita-\\ntion when we found him in his chambers. In a few hours the\\nexamination would commence, and he was still in the dilemma\\nbetween making the facts public and allowing the culprit to\\ncompete for the valuable scholarship. He could hardly stand still,\\nso great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes\\nwith two eager hands outstretched.\\n  \"Thank heaven that you have come! I feared that you had\\ngiven it up in despair. What am I to do? Shall the examination\\nproceed?\"\\n  \"Yes, let it proceed, by all means.\"\\n  \"But this rascal?\"\\n  \"He shall not compete.\"\\n  \"You know him?\"\\n  \"I think so. If this matter is not to become public. we must\\ngive ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small\\nprivate court-martial. You there, if you please, Soames! Watson\\nyou here! I\\'ll take the armchair in the middle. I think that we are\\nnow sufficiently imposing to strike terror into a guilty breast.\\nKindly ring the bell!\"\\n  Bannister entered, and shrank back in evident surprise and fear\\nat our judicial appearance.\\n  \"You will kindly close the door,\" said Holmes. \"Now\\nBannister, will you please tell us the truth about yesterday\\'s\\nincident.\\'\\n  The man turned white to the roots of his hair.\\n  \"I have told you everything, sir.\"\\n  \"Nothing to add?\"\\n  \"Nothing at all, sir.\"\\n  \"Well, then, I must make some suggestions to you. When you\\nsat down on that chair yesterday, did you do so in order to\\nconceal some object which would have shown who had been in\\nthe room?\"\\n  Bannister\\'s face was ghastly.\\n  \"No, sir, certainly not.\"\\n  \"It is only a suggestion,\" said Holmes, suavely. \"I frankly\\nadmit that I am unable to prove it. But it seems probable enough\\nsince the moment that Mr. Soames\\'s back was turned, you\\nreleased the man who was hiding in that bedroom.\"\\n  Bannister licked his dry lips.\\n  \"There was no man, sir.\"\\n  \"Ah, that\\'s a pity, Bannister. Up to now you may have\\nspoken the truth, but now I know that you have lied.\"\\n  The man\\'s face set in sullen defiance.\\n  \"There was no man, sir.\"\\n  \"Come, come, Bannister!\"\\n  \"No, sir, there was no one.\"\\n  \"In that case, you can give us no further information. Would\\nyou please remain in the room? Stand over there near the bed-\\nroom door. Now, Soames, I am going to ask you to have the\\ngreat kindness to go up to the room of young Gilchrist. and to\\nask him to step down into yours.\"\\n  An instant later the tutor returned, bringing with him the\\nstudent. He was a fine figure of a man, tall, lithe, and agile, with\\na springy step and a pleasant, open face. His troubled blue eyes\\nglanced at each of us, and finally rested with an expression of\\nblank dismay upon Bannister in the farther corner.\\n  \"Just close the door,\" said Holmes. \"Now, Mr. Gilchrist, we\\nare all quite alone here, and no one need ever know one word of\\nwhat passes between us. We can be perfectly frank with each\\nother. We want to know, Mr. Gilchrist, how you, an honourable\\nman, ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday?\"\\n  The unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look\\nfull of horror and reproach at Bannister.\\n  \"No, no, Mr. Gilchrist, sir, I never said a word -- never one\\nword!\" cried the servant.\\n  \"No, but you have now,\" said Holmes. \"Now, sir, you must\\nsee that after Bannister\\'s words your position is hopeless, and\\nthat your only chance lies in a frank confession.\"\\n  For a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control\\nhis writhing features. The next he had thrown himself on his\\nknees beside the table, and burying his face in his hands, he had\\nburst into a storm of passionate sobbing.\\n  \"Come, come,\" said Holmes, kindly, \"it is human to err,\\nand at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.\\nPerhaps it would be easier for you if I were to tell Mr. Soames\\nwhat occurred, and you can check me where I am wrong. Shall I\\ndo so? Well, well, don\\'t trouble to answer. Listen, and see that I\\ndo you no injustice.\\n  \"From the moment, Mr. Soames, that you said to me that no\\none, not even Bannister, could have told that the papers were in\\nyour room, the case began to take a definite shape in my mind.\\nThe printer one could, of course, dismiss. He could examine the\\npapers in his own office. The Indian I also thought nothing of. If\\nthe proofs were in a roll, he could not possibly know what they\\nwere. On the other hand, it seemed an unthinkable coincidence\\nthat a man should dare to enter the room, and that by chance on\\nthat very day the papers were on the table. I dismissed that. The\\nman who entered knew that the papers were there. How did he\\nknow?\\n  \"When I approached your room, I examined the window. You\\namused me by supposing that I was contemplating the possibility\\nof someone having in broad daylight, under the eyes of all these\\nopposite rooms, forced himself through it. Such an idea was\\nabsurd. I was measuring how tall a man would need to be in\\norder to see, as he passed, what papers were on the central table.\\nI am six feet high, and I could do it with an effort. No one less\\nthan that would have a chance. Already you see I had reason to\\nthink that, if one of your three students was a man of unusual\\nheight, he was the most worth watching of the three.\\n  \"I entered, and I took you into my confidencc as to the\\nsuggestions of the side table. Of the centre table I could make\\nnothing, until in your description of Gilchrist you mentioned that\\nhe was a long-distance jumper. Then the whole thing came to me\\nin an instant, and I only needed certain corroborative proofs,\\nwhich I speedily obtained.\\n  \"What happened was this: This young fellow had employed\\nhis afternoon at the athletic grounds, where he had been practis-\\ning the jump. He returned carrying his jumping-shoes, which are\\nprovided, as you are aware, with several sharp spikes. As he\\npassed your window he saw, by means of his great height, these\\nproofs upon your table, and conjectured what they were. No\\nharm would have been done had it not been that, as he passed\\nyour door, he perceived the key which had been left by the\\ncarelessness of your servant. A sudden impulse came over him to\\nenter, and see if they were indeed the proofs. It was not a\\ndangerous exploit, for he could always pretend that he had simply\\nlooked in to ask a question.\\n  \"Well, when he saw that they were indeed the proofs, it was\\nthen that he yielded to temptation. He put his shoes on the table.\\nWhat was it you put on that chair near the window?\"\\n  \"Gloves,\" said the young man.\\n  Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister. \"He put his gloves\\non the chair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy\\nthem. He thought the tutor must return by the main gate, and that\\nhe would see him. As we know, he came back by the side gate.\\nSuddenly he heard him at the very door. There was no possible\\nescape. He forgot his gloves, but he caught up his shoes and\\ndarted into the bedroom. You observe that the scratch on that\\ntable is slight at one side, but deepens in the direction of the\\nbedroom door. That in itself is enough to show us that the shoe\\nhad been drawn in that direction, and that the culprit had taken\\nrefuge there. The earth round the spike had been left on the\\ntable, and a second sample was loosened and fell in the bed-\\nroom. I may add that I walked out to the athletic grounds this\\nmorning, saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumping-\\npit, and carried away a specimen of it, together with some of the\\nfine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete\\nfrom slipping. Have I told the truth, Mr. Gilchrist?\"\\n  The student had drawn himself erect.\\n  \"Yes, sir, it is true,\" said he.\\n  \"Good heavens! have you nothing to add?\" cried Soames.\\n  \"Yes, sir, I have, but the shock of this disgraceful exposure\\nhas bewildered me. I have a letter here, Mr. Soames, which I\\nwrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night.\\nIt was before I knew that my sin had found me out. Here it is,\\nsir. You will see that I have said, \\'I have determined not to go\\nin for the examination. I have been offered a commission in\\nthe Rhodesian Police, and I am going out to South Africa at\\nonce.\\' \"\\n  \"I am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit\\nby your unfair advantage,\" said Soames. \"But why did you\\nchange your purpose?\"\\n  Gilchrist pointed to Bannister.\\n  \"There is the man who set me in the right path,\" said he.\\n  \"Come now, Bannister,\" said Holmes. \"It will be clear to\\nyou, from what I have said, that only you could have let this\\nyoung man out, since you were left in the room, and must have\\nlocked the door when you went out. As to his escaping by that\\nwindow, it was incredible. Can you not clear up the last point in\\nthis mystery, and tell us the reasons for your action?\"\\n  \"It was simple enough, sir, if you only had known, but, with\\nall your cleverness, it was impossible that you could know. Time\\nwas, sir, when I was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young\\ngentleman\\'s father. When he was ruined I came to the college as\\nservant, but I never forgot my old employer because he was\\ndown in the world. I watched his son all I could for the sake of\\nthe old days. Well, sir, when I came into this room yesterday,\\nwhen the alarm was given, the very first thing I saw was Mr.\\nGilchrist\\'s tan gloves a-lying in that chair. I knew those gloves\\nwell, and I understood their message. If Mr. Soames saw them,\\nthe game was up. I flopped down into that chair, and nothing\\nwould budge me until Mr. Soames went for you. Then out came\\nmy poor young master, whom I had dandled on my knee, and\\nconfessed it all to me. Wasn\\'t it natural, sir, that I should save\\nhim, and wasn\\'t it natural also that I should try to speak to him\\nas his dead father would have done, and make him understand\\nthat he could not profit by such a deed? Could you blame me,\\nsir?\"\\n  \"No, indeed,\" said Holmes, heartily, springing to his feet.\\n  \"Well, Soames, I think we have cleared your little problem up,\\nand our breakfast awaits us at home. Come, Watson! As to you,\\nsir, I trust that a bright future awaits you in Rhodesia. For once\\nyou have fallen low. Let us see, in the future, how high you can\\nrise.\"\\n\\x1a'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":98}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# after
